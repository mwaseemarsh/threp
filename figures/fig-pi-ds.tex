\caption{Key data structures for Posted Interrupt processing. Virtual APIC page is used by VT-x to virtualize interrupt controller memory accesses. 
PINV is the interrupt vector number that uses PID data structure for delivery without exit.
PID consists of an ON bit and PIR bitmasks. Host marks PIR bit corresponding to interrupt vector and sets the ON bit
to deliver interrupt directly to the guest.}
