\caption{Comparison of virtual and direct guest interrupt delivery. 
On left, the guest interrupt is delivered to the hypervisor, and hypervisor injects the interrupt as a virtual interrupt. 
On right, interrupt is directly delivered to the guest using DII mechanism, without hypervisor involvement.}
